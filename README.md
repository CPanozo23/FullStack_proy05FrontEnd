## 1. Introduction

This project is based on the need of a real client, who is a psychologist who provides online services. Currently there are different platforms that provide this type of service, however, they are not personalized, they do not have their own brand.

The site has been built from scratch, starting with the design of Carolina Panozo's personal brand to the management of hours so that e-commerce users can reserve hours for themselves as well as for other people they are in charge of.

## 2. Characteristics
Being a prototype, it mainly shows the actions that customers can perform:

* Log in
* Sign off
* Update data
* Add patients
* select hours
* View shopping cart with the total to pay
* See next hours

## 3. Considerations
As it is a reservation system, if within 5 minutes of selecting an hour it has not been paid for, it will be available again.

## 4. Future improvements

Considering that it is a project that will be carried out, the administrator dashboard will be created where you can manage hours, reservations and patient information.
